- making sure to save emails as lower case all the time

=== 0.2.4 ===

- BUGFIX!! Fixed typo in urls.py. Thanks to `DmitryGit` for reporting this!

=== 0.2.3 ===

- Replaced usage of `direct_to_template` with `TemplateView` because the former
  doesn't exist in Django 1.5 any more.

=== 0.2.2 ===

- made username generation more robust to avoid name clashes

=== 0.2.1 ===

- Added method `generate_username` in `forms.py` so you can re-use it in your
  own apps.

=== 0.2.0 ===

- Added new settings: REGISTRATION_EMAIL_REGISTER_SUCCESS_URL and
  REGISTRATION_EMAIL_ACTIVATE_SUCCESS_URL. This allows to override the standard
  redirect without overriding the urls.py.
